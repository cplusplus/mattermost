Before reporting an issue, please note the following:
- Do not share passwords when reporting issues!
- The WG21 Mattermost chat service is limited to WG21 participants.
  This includes WG21 members and select invited experts.
  This service is not open to the public.
- To create an account, an invite code is required.
  A link with an embedded invite code can be found on the "Real-time Communication Tools" page
  of the "WG21 introductory and general information" wiki.
  If you don't know where to find the WG21 wiki, then you are probably not approved to use the
  WG21 chat service.
  Links to the wiki are intentionally not provided here.
