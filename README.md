# WG21 Mattermost chat service issue tracker
This repository is used to track service, support, and enhancement requests for the Mattermost chat service
hosted by the Standard C++ Foundation for use by WG21 participants.
The
[WG21 Admin Group](https://isocpp.org/std/the-committee)
is responsible for monitoring and resolving issues reported here and for administration of user accounts.

Use of the WG21 Mattermost chat service is limited to WG21 participants.
This includes WG21 members (people with an entry in the ISO global directory) and select invited experts
(you'll know if you are an invited expert).
This service is not open to the public.

# How to file support requests
To file a support request, navigate to the
[Issues tab](https://github.com/cplusplus/mattermost/issues)
and click "New issue".
Review the issue templates presented.
If one of those matches the problem you are experiencing, click the corresponding "Get started" button.
Otherwise, click the "Open a blank issue" link and fill in the title and comment with a detailed description
of the problem. Be sure to include your Mattermost username when reporting account specific problems.

## How to register an account
To create an account, an invite code is required.
A link with an embedded invite code can be found on the "Real-time Communication Tools" page of the
"WG21 introductory and general information" wiki.
If you don't know where to find the WG21 wiki, then you are probably not approved to use the WG21 chat service.
Links to the wiki are intentionally not provided here.
Open the link on that page to register an account.
